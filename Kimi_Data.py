User Input:
The user will provide a title (e.g., "God’s Message: Only 5 People Are on the List... Your Name Is in Position 1").

Objective:
Generate a 4,000-word highly engaging script designed to compel viewers to comment (e.g., "555," "777," "Jesus is best," "Amen").

Instructions:

Format & Style:

Write in short paragraphs (maximum 3 sentences per paragraph).

Script content should resemble a YouTube video caption or narrative format—pure text with no headings or bullet points.

Maintain a mysterious, urgent, and uplifting tone.

Key Elements:

Start the script with the phrase "Archangel Michael says…" (use this phrase 2–3 times throughout the script).

Every 4 paragraphs, include a "Call to Comment" (e.g., "Type 333 for breakthrough," "Comment ‘Jesus’ for healing," "Type ‘Amen’ for blessings"). Alternate between numbers (e.g., 111, 555, 777) and uplifting words (e.g., Amen, Glory, Jesus).

Content Rules:

No questions, proverbs, or Bible verses.

Avoid filler—make every line engaging, emotional, and purposeful.

Add urgency with phrases like:

"This message expires in 24 hours…"

"Heaven is watching now… Your name is written in golden light…"

Tone & Emotional Hooks:

Build suspense: "This is not a coincidence. Heaven chose you today. Angels are waiting for your response."

Create a personal connection: "God saw your struggles… This is your sign!"

Use emotional triggers to inspire immediate action.

Structure Example:

Hook: "Archangel Michael says… A divine list has just appeared in the heavens. Only 5 names are written… and yours is first."

Build suspense: "This moment is unlike any other. The angels are watching closely… waiting to bless you."

Call to Comment: "Type ‘555’ now—the heavens are releasing your miracle!"

Repeat pattern with new blessings and calls to comment every 4 paragraphs.

Length:

The script must be 3,000–4,000 words (strict minimum of 3,000 words).

Final Reminder:
The script must feel personal, supernatural, and emotionally charged, leaving viewers compelled to comment without hesitation. Ensure it creates a sense of urgency and divine significance.
